There are currently four ways to get started with LIGO. You can choose to use a Docker image, a static Linux binary, install packages for your Debian Linux distribution, or you can try directly on the [online editor](https://ide.ligolang.org/).

## Ligo installation

## Online Editor

The online editor is the quickest and easiest way to get started.

You can choose your preferred syntax and write your LIGO instructions directly in the text editor. It is available at [ligolang.org](https://ligolang.org/) in the [Try Online](https://ide.ligolang.org/) tab.
